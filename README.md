Sophena
=======
Sophena is a quick planning tool for local heating networks. See [here](https://www.carmen-ev.de/infothek/downloads/sophena/1989-sophena-die-software)
for further information.

## Building from source
Sophena is an Eclipse RCP application with a setup very similar to 
[openLCA](https://github.com/GreenDelta/olca-app). Thus, you should be able to
compile the application from source when you follow the steps documented in
the openLCA repository.
