# sophdat
sophdat generates the database packages for Sophena. It takes data from CSV
and JSON files in the `data` folder and creates zip files that can be then
imported into Sophena. There are also scripts in this repository that prepare
the CSV files for this conversion from an Excel file (i.e. `xls2csv.py`).
sophdat is a simple command line tool written in [Go](https://golang.org/).
If you have Go installed, just switch to the `sophdat` folder and compile the
tool:

```bash
cd sophdat
go build
```

This should produce a `sophdat` executable in this folder. After this, copy the
product and weather data that are *not* distributed with the repository into the
respective data folders (see below) and run the tool:

```bash
./sophdat  # or sopdat.exe on Windows
```

The `data` folder should have the following content:

* `data/csv/*.csv`: The CSV files with base and product data (see the format
    definition below)
* `data/json/cost_settings/*.json`: The default cost settings of Sophena.
* `data/json/weather_stations/*.json`: The climate data of the weather stations
    that are included in the base data of Sophena.

## Product data
In the following the format of the CSV files with the product data is described.
All CSV files should be encoded in `UTF-8` and the column separator should be a
semicolon, otherwise the conversion will not correctly work. Also, the first row
is expected to contain the column headers and is ignored. The entries can
have leading and trailing space characters in order to align the entries in a
column so that they are easier to read in plain text editors (see the
`csvfmt.py` script). These leading and trailing space characters are removed
when generating the data packages.
